# Banking Application RSD - Acceptance Criteria, Test Scenarios, and Test Scope

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The banking application must allow users to create new accounts with valid personal and financial details.
2. Users must be able to log in securely using their credentials.
3. The system should support deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer functionalities with proper validation and transaction logging.
4. Account balances must be updated in real-time after each transaction.
5. The application should provide account statements and transaction history to users.
6. All sensitive data must be encrypted and comply with security standards.
7. The application must handle invalid inputs and display appropriate error messages.
8. Only authorized users should be able to access admin features and perform account management tasks.

## Test Scenarios
1. Verify account creation with valid and invalid data.
2. Test user login with correct and incorrect credentials.
3. Validate deposit functionality for different account types and amounts.
4. Test withdrawal process, including insufficient balance scenarios.
5. Verify fund transfer between accounts, including edge cases (e.g., same account, invalid account).
6. Check real-time balance updates after transactions.
7. Generate and review account statements for accuracy.
8. Test security features: password encryption, session management, and access control.
9. Validate error handling for all user actions.
10. Test admin functionalities: account management, user role assignment, and audit logs.

## Test Scope
- Functional testing of all banking operations (account creation, login, deposit, withdrawal, transfer).
- Security testing (authentication, authorization, data encryption).
- Usability testing (UI/UX, error messages, navigation).
- Performance testing (transaction speed, concurrent users).
- Data integrity and consistency checks.
- Regression testing for future updates.
- Exclusion: Third-party integrations and non-banking modules are out of scope for this phase.
